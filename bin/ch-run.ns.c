/* This program enters a UDSS and sets up partial isolation using namespaces.
   By default, the basic steps are:

     1. Set up 3 of the 6 namespaces:
        * mount - filesystem isolation
        * IPC - SysV and POSIX shared memory, etc.
        * user - so root within the container is unprivileged
     2. Call pivot_root(2) to enter the UDSS (similar to chroot).
     3. Unmount the old root filesystem.
     4. exec(2) the user program.

   There are preprocessor constants to alter this behavior, documented below.

   Due to the user namespace, this program is not setuid root despite use of
   privileged system calls. This eliminates the need to safely drop privileges
   before invoking user code.

   The following container isolation mechanisms are available, but we do not
   use them:

     * UTS and network namespaces are omitted so the guest can use host
       network resources directly, without bridges and whatnot.

     * The PID namespace has a subtle quirk: the first process created become
       the namespace's init, and if it exits, the kernel sends all the other
       processes in the container SIGKILL and no more can be created -- fork()
       fails with ENOMEM. As a result, a wrapper like this one cannot use a
       plain exec() pattern but must use the more complicated fork() + exec(),
       or perhaps something based on clone(CLONE_PARENT). See e.g.:

         http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pid_namespaces.7.html
         https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=894623

       This introduces the need for a supervisor process to pass through
       signals and perhaps other things. We want to avoid that.

     * cgroups are not needed because we assume single-tenancy, so there
       aren't other jobs to mess up. */

/** Constants **/

/* There are three mount points in play for a successful pivot_root(2) into a
   UDSS and unmount of the host filesystem.

     1. newroot  This is the already-mounted UDSS filesystem we want to use.
     2. target   Place to bind-mount newroot after CLONE_NEWUSER.
     3. oldroot  Where the old root filesystem is mounted after pivot_root.

   target would seem to be unnecessary. However, CLONE_NEWUSER|CLONE_NEWNS
   introduces some restrictions. In particular, pivot_root into a filesystem
   that was mounted before CLONE_NEWUSER fails with EINVAL. One can work
   around this by bind-mounting newroot to target before pivot_root.

   Another way to work around this would be to do all UDSS mounting after
   CLONE_NEWUSER. This requires setting up the loop device manually
   (mount(8)'s -o loop option is implemented by the mount program, not libc or
   the system call). This is not yet explored. In particular, teardown of the
   loop device might be an issue, since by the time that's needed, we've
   replaced ourselves with the user program. However, in theory, the loop
   device ought to be local to the filesystem namespace. */
