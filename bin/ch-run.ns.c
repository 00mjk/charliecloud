/* This program enters a UDSS and sets up partial isolation using namespaces.
   By default, the basic steps are:

     1. Set up 3 of the 6 namespaces:
        * mount - filesystem isolation
        * IPC - SysV and POSIX shared memory, etc.
        * user - so root within the container is unprivileged
     2. Call pivot_root(2) to enter the UDSS (similar to chroot).
     3. Unmount the old root filesystem.
     4. exec(2) the user program.

   There are preprocessor constants to alter this behavior, documented below.

   Due to the user namespace, this program is not setuid root despite use of
   privileged system calls. This eliminates the need to safely drop privileges
   before invoking user code.

   The following container isolation mechanisms are available, but we do not
   use them:

     * UTS and network namespaces are omitted so the guest can use host
       network resources directly, without bridges and whatnot.

     * The PID namespace has a subtle quirk: the first process created become
       the namespace's init, and if it exits, the kernel sends all the other
       processes in the container SIGKILL and no more can be created -- fork()
       fails with ENOMEM. As a result, a wrapper like this one cannot use a
       plain exec() pattern but must use the more complicated fork() + exec(),
       or perhaps something based on clone(CLONE_PARENT). See e.g.:

         http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pid_namespaces.7.html
         https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=894623

       This introduces the need for a supervisor process to pass through
       signals and perhaps other things. We want to avoid that.

     * cgroups are not needed because we assume single-tenancy, so there
       aren't other jobs to mess up. */

      2. 1 <= UID/GID <= 999 are unmapped. These are the system users and

      3. UID/GID >= 1000 are mapped through unchanged. That is, normal users
         appear the same inside the container as outside.

      A possible additional step is to write "deny" to /proc/self/setgroups.
      This prevents use of setgroups(2) within the container. The uses case is
      files with permissions like "rwx---rwx", where group permissions are
      less than other. Because users essentially run as themselves within a

      disable setgroups(2) -- this extra step has limited value. */
