Unpack a Docker export tarball into a directory.

Usage:

  $ $(basename $0) TARBALL DIR

If DIR doesn't exist, it is created and filled with the contents of TARBALL,
which must be a Linux filesystem image, e.g. from ch-docker2tar. If it does
exist, and appears to be a Charliecloud container image, it is removed and
replaced per above. Otherwise, the script aborts with an error.

Warning:

  Do not place DIR on a shared filesystem (e.g., your home directory, project
  space, scratch) unless specifically instructed by your site admins. Doing so
  will cause excess metadata load on the filesystem, resulting in poor
  performance for you and everyone else trying to do work at the same time.
