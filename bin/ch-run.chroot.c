/* This program has two basic jobs:

     1. chroot(2) into the Charliecloud image (privileged)
     2. Run the program the user wanted (as the user)

   The implicit step is to properly drop privileges before Step 2 so that we
   really run the users program as him or her. That is, particular care is
   required because this program does not need to be exploited in order to run
   arbitrary code; doing so is the whole point.

   This program is designed to run setuid root. It will in fact refuse to run
   if invoked directly by root, because this makes validation of no privilege
   after dropping more complicated.

   It would be better to use capabilities and run setcap CAP_SYS_CHROOT rather
   than setuid. However, file capabilities depend on extended attributes,
   which are not available on NFSv3, which is a key deployment target as of
   August 2015.

   Most of the logic in this program deals with dropping privileges safely,
   which is a non-trivial task [e.g., 1]. We follow the recommendations in
   [1], supplemented by [2, 3]. More specifically, we use the setresuid(2) and
   setresgid(2) calls, which have a simpler API than the POSIX setuid(2) and
   setgid(2), and we validate the lack of privilege after dropping.

   We do not worry about:

     * Supplemental groups. Because we do not change the supplemental groups,
       nothing needs to be dropped.

     * Linux-specific fsuid and fsgid, which track euid/egid unless
       specifically changed, which we do not. Kernel bugs have existed which
       violate this invariant, but none are recent. Also, there are no
       functions to query the fsuid and fsgid (you must read files in /proc).

   While we have not deliberatedly introduced any non-portable code, this
   program is designed for Linux 2.6.32+ and is untested elsewhere.
