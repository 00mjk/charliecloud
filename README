Charliecloud provides user-defined software stacks (UDSS) for high-performance
computing (HPC) centers. This "bring your own software stack" functionality
addresses needs such as:

  * software dependencies that are numerous, complex, unusual, diferently
    configured, or simply newer/older than what the center provides;

  * build-time requirements unavailable within the center, such as relatively
    unfettered internet access;

  * validated software stacks and configuration to meet the standards of a
    particular field of inquiry;

  * portability of environments between resources, including workstations and
    other test and development system not managed by the center;

  * consistent environments, even archivally so, that can be easily,
    reliabily, and verifiably reproduced in the future; and/or

  * usability and comprehensibility.

This is done using Linux user namespaces to run industry-standard Docker
containers with no privileged operations or daemons and minimal configuration
changes on center resources. This simple approach avoids most security risks
while maintaining access to the performance and functionality already on
offer.

Because user namespaces are available only in newer kernel versions, an
experimental setuid mode is also provided to let sites evaluate Charliecloud
even if they do not have user namespace-capable kernels readily available.

Patches are much appreciated on the software itself as well as documentation.
We are friendly and welcoming of diversity on all dimensions.

Charliecloud's original path was to use virtual machines (QEMU and KVM). This
code and documentation has been removed from the master branch but is still
available in the virtual-machines branch. We are open to re-including it in
master, given a volunteer to maintain it.
