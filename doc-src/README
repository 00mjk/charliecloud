This documentation is built using Sphinx with the sphinx-rtd-theme.

Currently, we use Python 2.7 for building the docs. Python 3.x is untested.


To build the HTML
-----------------

Make sure you have a current version of sphinx-rtd-theme installed:

  $ pip install sphinx-rtd-theme

Then:

  $ make

The HTML files are copied to ../doc with rsync. Anything that should not be
copied should be listed in RSYNC_EXCLUDE.

There is also a "clean" target that removes all the derived files as well as
everything in ../doc.


Publishing to the web
---------------------

If you have write access to the repository, you can update the web
documentation (i.e., http://hpc.github.io/charliecloud).

Normally, ../doc is normal directory that is ignored by Git. To publish to the
web, that diretory needs to contain a Git checkout of the gh-pages branch (not
a submodule). To set that up:

  $ rm -Rf doc
  $ git clone git@github.com:hpc/charliecloud.git doc
  $ cd doc
  $ git checkout gh-pages

To publish:

  $ make web

It sometimes takes a few minutes for the web pages to update.
