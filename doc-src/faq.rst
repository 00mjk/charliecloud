:code:`--uid 0` lets me read files I can't otherwise!
=====================================================

Some permission bits can give a surprising result with a container UID of 0.
For example::

  $ whoami
  reidpr
  $ echo surprise > ~/cantreadme
  $ chmod 000 ~/cantreadme
  $ ls -l ~/cantreadme
  ---------- 1 reidpr reidpr 9 Oct  3 15:03 /home/reidpr/cantreadme
  $ cat ~/cantreadme
  cat: /home/reidpr/cantreadme: Permission denied
  $ ch-run /data/$USER.hello cat ~/cantreadme
  cat: /home/reidpr/cantreadme: Permission denied
  $ ch-run --uid 0 /data/$USER.hello cat ~/cantreadme
  surprise

At first glance, it seems that we've found an escalation -- we were able to
read a file inside a container that we could not read on the host! That seems
bad.

However, what is really going on here is more prosaic but complicated:

1. After :code:`unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)`, :code:`ch-run` gains all capabilities
   inside the namespace. (Outside, capabilities are unchanged.)

2. This include :code:`CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE`, which enables a process to
   read/write/execute a file or directory mostly regardless of its permission
   bits. (This is why root isn't limited by permissions.)

3. Within the container, :code:`exec(2)` capability rules are followed.
   Normally, this essentially means that all capabilities are dropped when
   :code:`ch-run` replaces itself with the user command. However, if EUID is 0
   --- which it is inside the namespace given :code:`--uid 0` --- then the
   subprocess keeps all its capabilities. (This makes sense: if root creates a
   new process, it stays root.)

4. :code:`CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` within a user namespace is honored for a file or
   directory only if its UID and GID are both mapped. In this case,
   :code:`ch-run` maps :code:`reidpr` to container :code:`root` and group
   :code:`reidpr` to itself.

5. Thus, files and directories owned by the host EUID and EGID (here
   :code:`reidpr:reidpr`) are available for all access with :code:`ch-run
   --uid 0`.

This isn't a problem. The quirk applies only to files owned by the invoking
user, because :code:`ch-run` is unprivileged outside the namespace, and thus
he or she could simply :code:`chmod` the file to read it. That is, access
inside and outside the container remains equivalent.
